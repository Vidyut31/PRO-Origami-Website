        <ul>
            <li>Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.</li>
            <li>The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different
                objects at the same time. This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.</li>
            <li>Chameleons are not deaf but they do not actually have ear openings.
            </li>

            <p><i>Interesting facts about Camel</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Camels travel in herds and both dromedary and Bactrian camels are social creatures. Groups are
                    composed of as many as 30 individuals including a family unit with one dominant male.</li>
                <li>When a camel does come across water, it can fill up in a hurry, drinking as much as 26 gallons in 10
                    minutes</li>
                <li>Camel's milk is lower in cholesterol and higher in vitamin C and minerals like sodium and potassium
                    compared with the milk of other ruminants
                </li>
